# Filtered Task Loop

You are running as part of a SquadDash autonomous loop. **Each iteration must complete exactly one task** from `.squad/tasks.md`, then stop. The next iteration will pick up the next task.

> Iteration: {{iteration}}

## Step 1 — Find the next **filtered** task

Read `.squad/tasks.md`. Find the **first unchecked (`- [ ]`) item** that is NOT owned by `*(Owner: User)*` and that contains the words or otherwise matches the filter instructions specified below. Work top-to-bottom; higher sections (🔴 High, 🟡 Mid) take priority over lower ones (🟢 Low).

[**FILTER**]

## Step 2 — If NO actionable tasks remain

No unchecked tasks remain (or all remaining tasks are Owner: User). Do the following and nothing else:

1. Append this block at the **very end** of your response (after all other content):
   ```
   HOST_COMMAND_JSON:
   [
     { "command": "stop_loop" }
   ]
   ```
2. Do not attempt any further work this iteration.

## Step 3 — If a task IS found, implement it fully

1. Read `.squad/routing.md` to identify the correct owner/agent for this task.
2. Delegate to or become that agent. Complete the work — implementation, decisions, tests, commit.
3. For **"define…" or "decide…" or "architecture" tasks**: document the decision in `.squad/decisions.md` (create if missing) and update relevant architecture docs, then consider the task done.
4. For **implementation tasks**:
   - `build_verify` = `{{build_verify}}` — if `true` and `{{build_command}}` is non-empty, run `{{build_command}}` and verify it succeeds before proceeding.
   - `commit_after_task` = `{{commit_after_task}}`:
     - `always` → commit immediately and report the SHA. Include trailer: `{{copilot_trailer}}`
     - `never` → skip commit; describe the diff instead.
     - `ask` → emit a quick-reply "Commit changes?" and wait for confirmation before committing.
5. After work is complete, mark the task `[x]` in `.squad/tasks.md` and move it to the "Recently Completed" section at the bottom.
6. Report a one-line summary of what was done.

## Step 4 — Write tests (if applicable)

`test_after_task` = `{{test_after_task}}` — if `true`, create comprehensive test cases for what was built this iteration. If `false`, skip this step.

## Step 5 — Surface human decisions

If there are any important decisions that need to be made by a human at this point, put those up as quick reply buttons.
